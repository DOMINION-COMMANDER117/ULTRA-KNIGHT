# STEP 2 ( CLOUDS, AND SEQUENCE DATA )

**THE TOD 'MASTER'** For chapter 6 Can look complex, confusing, and you may just be like ''whatever, I dont want this, its too hard'' But Trust me, I Have gone through the difficult steps on finding out the errors. Replacing them, and getting the perfect working result for everyone.

Beging By Opening the folder, Going to cloud meshes, and Selecting all the meshes with the name,  " BAKED CLOUDS" Only about 5 extra Meshes Should be left over after your done that arent clouds.
Drag them into the world, and be patient. Its taking time to load about 30 meshes in. Dont click anything or spam any buttons. You may wind up crashing your editor, if its low end, and loosing your progress.
Once they apear, Set everything ( Cordinate wise ) To 0 , 0 , 0           and The rotations all to the same. Set your scale to 1,1,1.

Follow the Video below if you **DONT** Understand.


https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b975edc-817f-4573-b7c3-11f295770695



**ONCE SET TO ZERO 1,1,1 and no rotation. Move to the next steps

# SEQUENCE DATA AND REPLACEMENTS

When you load this into your project, this could be set up for you, but theres a **HIGHER** Chance its not. You will have to open the sequence that comes in the file, and replace the items yourself. 

Before you do that, get the following items into your world.


DIRECTION LIGHT ( Can be found using the green plus at the top of your screen, and found under the **LIGHS** Catagory

HEIGHT FOG ( + Button ) Visual Effects, Height Fog.


Set these items to 1 scale and o for rotations, and location.

Open your sequence.

Follow this short guide and instructional step by step list, on how to replace refrences, and missing asset calls.

**OPEN A SECONDARY CONTENT BROWSER WINDOW** Drag the Ch6 TOD BP ( BluePrint ) Into the worls and set at 0,0,0,
In your sequence, select the TOD Actor, RIGHT CLICK, Actions, Replace with selected.


https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b19a758-49b8-4e47-a7de-2a4ae1e2850d



Follow these exact same steps for all the listed items required in the Sequence. **THEN SAVE**
If you did everything correctly it should be working.

***TIPS AND TRICKS**

RENDER DISTANCE ( CLOUDS  ) Are not showing in game. ( HEAD INTO UEFN ) And select all your cloud meshes you drug out ealier. Go on the right hand side, Select LOD BIAS, and scroll down a bit. Select **MAXIMUM** Draw Distance. And enter this number 100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 ( WITH ALL THEM SELECTED )
It will glitch the items into inf ( No low unviewable distance ) Making sure your clouds are always visible, in game.

**ADD A SEQUENCE DEVICE TO YOU WORLD. PUT THE SEQUENCE INTO IT, and SELECT LOOP AND AUTO ACTIVE **ON** Push Chages, And you have yourself a Automatic TOD, Sequence. 
Increasing, or decreasing the play rate, slows, and speeds up how fast the sequence plays in the world. For a faster tod, sequences, increase it. And lower it for the oppisite effect.
